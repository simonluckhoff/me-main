			<h1>Hi, I'm Simon Luckhoff</h1>
			<p>
				By day an avid car photographer and by night a wannabe coder. <br /><br />
				My passion lays with cars ever since I was a little boy. Later on in High School I was exposed to taking
				photos where my love for photography began. Merging the two only seemed like the appropriate thing to do.
				<br /><br />
				From 2021 to 2023 I completed my Bachelors degree in Visual Communication, majoring in Art Direction. Ever
				since I can remember, I took on freelance jobs. In 2021 I began work for The Archive Automotive.
				<br /><br />
				My life completely changed, I went from a little boy taking photos of his dog to taking photos of some of
				the most rare cars in South Africa.
				<br /><br />
				Recently I began this coding journey (yes, I coded this website), something I was exposed to very briefly
				during my degree.
